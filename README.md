Repository for SNHU CS-330 class


How do I approach designing software?

  This probably isn't the best way to do things, but I employ a lot of trial and error. 
  As I became more experienced in this class I attempted to do things in a more iterative and modular way as time went on.
  Making sure to keep my code clean and organized, so that I could understand it when I needed to use it later.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

  I can now create 3d meshes. I can apply color, adjust the position and size, as well as add texture to the meshes.
  I can also implement lighting to a scene now.

What design process did you follow for your project work?

  I used a modular design process. I was able to implement functions I created in the past on future assignments.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

  By using an iterative design strategy, I would be better able to work with a team and combine our resources by creating modular code that we could all develop simaltainiously.

How do I approach developing programs?
  When developing programs, I start by clearly defining the objectives and requirements, followed by planning a structured, modular approach that allows for iterative development and testing

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

  While working on my 3D scene, I implemented strategies like layering to build the scene step by step, and utilized encapsulation to keep different aspects of the code separate and manageable.

How did iteration factor into your development?

  Each iterative cycle enabled me to incrementally improve the scene's features, such as lighting, textures, and mesh designs, and to troubleshoot and fine-tune the performance and visual aesthetics effectively.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

 Initially, my focus was on basic functionality and getting a rough version of the project working. As I progressed, I shifted towards optimizing the code for efficiency and readability, incorporating more advanced techniques in 3D graphics, and ensuring robustness and scalability
 
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

  Computer Science allows me to employ innovative solutions to problems. I want to be a data analysty so using programs to find trends in data quickly would be helpful.
  
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  Experience is a big help. I think in the future I will keep my code more organized and efficient thanks to the things I learned in this class
  
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

  Professionally I think this class has taught me ways to code that would be more helpful in a team setting. By clearly explaining my code, keeping it organized, and iteratively updating the code it allows for better results in a team environment.
